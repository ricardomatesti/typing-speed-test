# Typing Speed Test

![Design preview for the Typing Speed Test coding challenge](./preview.jpg)

## Welcome! 👋

This is a solution to the [Typing Speed Test challenge](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/typing-speed-test). You can check the [live site right here](https://typing-speed-test-omega-two.vercel.app/).

It was built using vanilla HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

This is a simple Web App to test your typing skills. You can choose the difficulty level and start writing. Every mistake lowers the accuracy score and you can correct the mistakes using the Backslash ⬅️. The WPM (words per minute) record gets saved in your localstorage.
